   <div class="text"> <h3>Solar System</h3> <p class="description">Our solar system orbits the Sun in the Milky Way galaxy, comprising eight planets from scorching Mercury to distant Neptune.
     Inner planets include Venus with its thick clouds and Earth, our habitable home.
      Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn boast spectacular rings, while icy Uranus and Neptune lie farther out.
     Moons, asteroids, and comets populate its expanse, with the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud marking its boundaries.
      It's a realm of wonder and scientific exploration.

  <div id="Mercury" class="planet"><div class="text"> <h3>Mercury</h3><p class="description">
    Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is a barren, airless world of extremes.
     Its surface, heavily cratered and scarred by impacts, reflects its tumultuous history.
      With temperatures ranging from scorching highs of 800 degrees Fahrenheit (427 degrees Celsius) to frigid lows of -290 degrees Fahrenheit (-180 degrees Celsius) in its stark,
        thin atmosphere, Mercury experiences the most significant temperature variations in the solar system.
       Despite its proximity to the Sun, this small planet has no atmosphere to retain heat, contributing to its stark temperature differentials.
     Mercury completes a full orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.

  <div id="Venus" class="planet"><div class="text"><h3>Venus</h3><p class="description">
    Venus, often called Earth's twin due to its similar size and composition, is a hostile world of extreme conditions.
     Cloaked in thick clouds of sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide, its atmosphere traps heat, creating surface temperatures that soar to a blistering 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius)—hot enough to melt lead.
      Despite its proximity to Earth, Venus' surface is a barren expanse marked by vast volcanic plains and numerous impact craters.
     Its dense atmosphere swirls with hurricane-force winds and holds clues to a runaway greenhouse effect that transformed what might have once been a more Earth-like planet into a searing, inhospitable realm.

  <div id="Earth" class="planet"><div class="text"><h3>Earth</h3><p class="description">
    Earth, the third planet from the Sun and the only known world to harbor life, is a diverse and dynamic oasis in the cosmos.
     With a breathable atmosphere rich in nitrogen and oxygen, Earth supports a vast array of ecosystems—from lush forests to expansive oceans teeming with biodiversity.
      Its surface, composed of continents and oceans, is sculpted by geological forces and home to billions of species, including humans.
       The planet's moderate climate, maintained by its atmosphere and proximity to the Sun, allows for stable conditions essential for life to thrive.
     Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), completing one orbit in approximately 365.25 days.

<div id="Mars" class="planet">
  <div class="text"><h3>Mars</h3><p class="description">
    Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is a cold, desert world with a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide.
     Known as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance from iron oxide, Mars has surface features reminiscent of both Earth and the Moon,
      including mountains, valleys, and polar ice caps.
      It hosts the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and a vast canyon, Valles Marineris.
       Mars' climate is harsh with extreme temperatures and frequent dust storms.
     Ongoing exploration aims to uncover past water activity and the planet's potential for supporting life.

<div id="Jupiter" class="planet"><div class="text"><h3>Jupiter</h3><p  class="description">
  Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest in our solar system.
   A gas giant, it primarily consists of hydrogen and helium, with a composition similar to a star.
    Known for its Great Red Spot, a massive storm persisting for centuries, Jupiter has a turbulent atmosphere marked by colorful bands and intense weather systems.
     It possesses a faint ring system and at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
   Jupiter's strong magnetic field and immense gravity have significant impacts on its surroundings, making it a key object of study in planetary science.

<div id="Saturn" class="planet"><div class="text"><h3>Saturn</h3><p class="description">
  Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is renowned for its stunning ring system, composed of ice and rock particles.
   A gas giant like Jupiter, Saturn is primarily made of hydrogen and helium.
   It has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere, with strong winds and storms marking its weather patterns.
    Saturn hosts at least 83 moons, with Titan being

the largest, known for its thick atmosphere and hydrocarbon lakes.
 The planet's low density allows it to float in water, and its rapid rotation flattens it at the poles.
  Saturn's magnetic field, though weaker than Jupiter's, plays a significant role in its dynamic system, influencing the planet's extensive magnetosphere.

<div id="Uranus" class="planet"><div class="text"><h3>Uranus</h3><p class="description">
  Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant with a pale blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. 
  Unique for its extreme axial tilt, Uranus appears to rotate on its side, causing unusual seasonal variations.
   The planet's atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, with faint cloud bands and strong winds. 
   Uranus has a faint ring system and at least 27 known moons, with Titania and Oberon being the largest.
    Its internal structure includes icy materials and rock, contributing to its classification as an ice giant.
   Uranus' magnetic field is notably tilted and offset from its center.

  <div id="Neptune" class="planet"><div class="text"><h3>Neptune</h3><p class="description">
    Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is an ice giant known for its deep blue color, caused by methane in its atmosphere.
     It features dynamic weather patterns, including the fastest winds in the solar system and large storm systems like the Great Dark Spot. 
     Neptune's atmosphere consists of hydrogen, helium, and methane, with a core of rock and ice.
      The planet has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and geologically active.
     Neptune's strong magnetic field is offset and tilted relative to its rotation, contributing to its complex and intriguing nature.
